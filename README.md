# GitHub PR Autolabel (WORK IN PROGRESS.........)

Simple and dumb experiment that allows you to automatically add labels before you open a PR. So that you don't accidentally forget a label and with that prevent certain actions from triggering, such as GitHub Slack integration. Unfortunately that integration doesn't work retroactively so if you forgot to add labels which you are subscribe to and you open a PR, GitHub Slack integration won't trigger.

So in that case you can manually paste what you need into Slack or close the PR and open it again, but just adding the label (which is kinda silly).
